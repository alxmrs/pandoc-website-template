description-meta: About this static site generator template.
---
This is a demo of a static site generator based [pandoc.org](https://pandoc.org/). It is meant to be hosted on [GitHub  Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and sometimes edited with [Decap CMS](http://decapcms.org/). 

This template aims to support experienced developers who want to build a website but feel that the state of web development is extremely, unnecessarily complicated.

Most people who want a website have very modest requirements. It seems strange that one would need to pay to continuously run a webserver – and database! – just to express ideas on the web. The theory of sites that use this template are to keep things as simple as possible.
